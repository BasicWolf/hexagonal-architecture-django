Experiments with Django and Hexagonal Architecture

## Project pulse

I've started this project to research how a Django project can be
built by principles of Hexagonal Architecture.
At the same time, I've been studying Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
While fairly understanding the first, DDD is something I continue
grokking every day.
If you fork, please visit this repo later to sync with the latest and
greatest trends in DDD and software craftsmanship.
The code is still evolving, as my understanding of the topics.

Originally, this project was a supporting example for
[Domain-driven design, Hexagonal architecture of ports and adapters, Dependency injection Ð¸ Python](https://habr.com/ru/post/559560/)
article.
The article was written in Russian language and was published on 31 May 2021
