Experiments with Django and Hexagonal Architecture

## Project pulse

I started this project to research building Django apps
following the Hexagonal Architecture and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles.
The code has been through numerous iterations and incarnations, as my understanding of 
the topics. It took me two and a half years to conclude the project and put down my 
experience in a series of articles.

While the project currently resides in a maintenance state, it's worth noting that 
all dependencies continue to be updated automatically via 
[Mend Renovate](https://www.mend.io/renovate/) (bless you, people!)
Moreover, the presence of an extensive test suite diligently ensures 
its ongoing relevance and accuracy.

## Finding your way around

**Installation**

Requires ``Python 3.10`` or later. CI runs on Python ``3.11``.

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Static type checks (mypy)**

```shell
export MYPYPATH=src/
mypy --namespace-packages -v -p myapp
```

**Run unit tests**

```shell
export PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:./:src/
export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE="hexarch_project.test_settings"
pytest
```

**Run application**

```shell
./src/manage.py migrate
./src/manage.py runserver
```

**Test with cURL**

With existing user:
```shell
curl http://localhost:8000/api/article_vote \
