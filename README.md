Experiments with Django and Hexagonal Architecture

## Project pulse

I started this project to research how to build a Django app
following the Hexagonal Architecture principles.
I've been as well studying Domain-Driven Design (DDD).
While understanding the first reasonably well, DDD is something I continue
grokking every day.
The code is still evolving, as is my understanding of the topics.
